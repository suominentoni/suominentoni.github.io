            We founded The Dash all the way back in 2003 when we were in our early 20’s. We were immediately enchanted by our oh-so-pop continuous harmony vocals that sounded to us so good that we could not stop laughing. We were enjoying music so much, like making music really should be enjoyed. It was naive and it was great.
            </p>

            <p>

            In the years to come we frequently performed live around Finland, wrote tons of songs and made a series of demos that sounded to us promising enough so we decided in 2008 to record a full album at our own cost and we were going to put all our effort into it. Like all the possible effort; I mean everything. This monsterous piece of Pro Tools tracks has sooo many layers on layers that it took over 6 months of intense work to record and mix with producer Pekka Laine and this is not including the pre production that we put a huge effort in before the rec button was pressed. And oh boy, we were so satisfied with it. This was early November 2008.
            </p>

            <p>
            After the master was completed I started a round of promotion going through the record labels. Some said no, but a fair share were interested in it. One said “the music doesn’t remind us enough of anything on the market”, which was a huge dissapointment personally, as this was exactly what we were after: a little bit fresh sound. Some offered a deal, but we felt our album was so important that the deals were nowhere nearly good enough. More time passed by and the huge effort we put into completing the album production had sucked most of the energy out of me at least. This is when the hard work should have started, but in hindsight I was completely unprepared for the business games, so I should have just concentrated on what was important - writing music - and hiring corporate muscle to deal with the wrestling.
            </p>

            <p>
            We tried not to get bored by this “waiting for something to happen” by starting to write album #2 and worked on half a dozen of tunes. It kept our spirit high for some time until the whole stagnated mood got the better of us and it took less than a year after our last live performance on the Oct 1st of 2009 that we pretty much stopped the whole band for quite some time. Ever since then, we’ve kept making music a bit, but almost completely concentrating on jamming on some random progressive riffs as the album material had a burden of failure on it. This is how I personally felt: the songs still sounded very good to me and I was so proud of all the hard work, but playing them after not getting anywhere with the completed master just brought a bag of very mixed feelings every time.
            </p>

            <p>
            Yet this album of course didn’t disappear anywhere and after half a decade we came back to it and it still sounded very relevant, at least to us. We eventually decided in 2015 that we should self-release the whole thing, just to get the music out and started to plan the process but in a typically “us” way, it took a whole year to have anything completed. But here we are back to where it started, the music. Enjoy the long lost tunes in timeless signature.

            This album is dedicated to our beloved friend Sten Heiskanen. The music lives on brother!
